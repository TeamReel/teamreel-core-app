# Work Packages: [FEATURE NAME]

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Only include explicit testing work when stakeholders request it.

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package must be independently deliverable and testable.

**Prompt Files**: Each work package references a matching prompt file in `/tasks/planned/` generated by `/spec-kitty.tasks`. Treat this file as the high-level checklist; keep deep implementation detail inside the prompt files.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`
- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different files/components).
- Include precise file paths or modules.

## Path Conventions

#### TeamReel Path Conventions (Constitutional Compliance)
- **Frontend modules**: `frontend/src/modules/{module_name}/` (camelCase for TS/React)
- **Backend apps**: `backend/apps/{app_name}/` (snake_case for Django/Python)  
- **AI workflows**: `ai/workflows/{workflow_name}/` (snake_case for Python)
- **Shared utilities**: Use `shared/` folders for reusable code (Reusability principle)
- **Tests**: Mirror source structure in `tests/` folders (Maintainability principle)

#### Naming Convention Enforcement
- **REST API endpoints**: kebab-case (`/user-profiles/`, `/video-workflows/`)
- **Python/Django**: snake_case for models, views, functions (`user_profile`, `video_workflow`)  
- **TypeScript/React**: camelCase for variables, functions, props (`userProfile`, `videoWorkflow`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE across all languages (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)

#### Constitutional Validation Integration
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: SE principle validation on all staged files
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Quality gate enforcement (coverage, complexity, security)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Constitutional compliance verified before merge
- **Task Validation**: Each work package includes constitutional compliance verification

## Work Package WP01: Setup & Environment (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Establish project skeleton and shared tooling.
**Independent Test**: Project bootstraps locally with linting and formatter hooks in place.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP01-setup-and-environment.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T001.1 Setup frontend/ with Next.js 14 + TypeScript (Portability)
- [ ] T001.2 Setup backend/ with Django REST Framework (Modularity)  
- [ ] T001.3 Setup ai/ with LangGraph workflows (SRP)
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T002.1 Configure ESLint + TypeScript for complexity limits (Simplicity)
- [ ] T002.2 Setup Pytest + coverage requirements (Testability)
- [ ] T002.3 Configure security headers + GDPR compliance (Defensibility)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools
- [ ] T003.1 Setup pre-commit hooks for code quality (Maintainability)
- [ ] T003.2 Configure Ruff for Python linting (complexity < 10)
- [ ] T003.3 Setup ESLint rules for TypeScript (DRY principle enforcement)

### Implementation Notes
- Major steps, commands, or configuration files required.

### Parallel Opportunities
- Highlight subtasks that can proceed concurrently.

### Dependencies
- None (starting package).

### Risks & Mitigations
- Example: Tooling compatibility across contributors; pin versions in `.tool-versions`.

## Work Package WP02: Foundational Platform (Priority: P0)

**Goal**: Deliver shared services all user stories depend on.
**Independent Test**: Foundational services pass smoke tests; downstream work packages can start.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP02-foundational-platform.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities shared across stories
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

### Implementation Notes
- Provide sequencing, infrastructure CLI commands, secrets requirements.

### Parallel Opportunities
- Authentication and routing can proceed in parallel once schema scaffolding exists.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP01.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Migration drift → enforce migration linting in CI.

## Work Package WP03: User Story 1 – [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of story outcome]
**Independent Test**: [Describe how to validate the story independently]
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP03-user-story-1.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T010 [P] Contract test for [endpoint] in `tests/contract/test_[name].py`
- [ ] T011 [P] Integration test for [journey] in `tests/integration/test_[name].py`
- [ ] T012 [P] Create [Entity1] model in `src/models/[entity1].py`
- [ ] T013 [P] Create [Entity2] model in `src/models/[entity2].py`
- [ ] T014 Implement [Service] in `src/services/[service].py` (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 Implement [endpoint/feature] in `src/[location]/[file].py`
- [ ] T016 Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 Add story-specific logging and metrics

### SE Principles Compliance Tasks *(mandatory)*
- [ ] T018 Validate SRP: Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] T019 Implement input validation (Defensibility)
- [ ] T020 Add interface abstraction layer (Encapsulation)  
- [ ] T021 Ensure loose coupling between modules (Modularity)
- [ ] T022 Add reusable components where applicable (Reusability)
- [ ] T023 Test portability across environments (Portability)
- [ ] T024 Verify complexity metrics < 10 (Simplicity)
- [ ] T025 Achieve 80%+ test coverage (Maintainability)

### Implementation Notes
- Enumerate the workflow (tests first if required, then models → services → endpoints).

### Parallel Opportunities
- Mention any subtasks that can be split among engineers safely.

### Dependencies
- Depends on WP02.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Data integrity risk → include migration rollback plan.

## Work Package WP0N: Polish & Cross-Cutting (Priority: Px)

**Goal**: Cross-story improvements and hardening work.
**Independent Test**: Regression suite passes; observability and documentation updated.
**Prompt**: `/tasks/planned/WP0N-polish-and-cross-cutting.md`

### Included Subtasks
- [ ] T0XX Documentation updates in `docs/`
- [ ] T0XX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T0XX Performance optimization across stories
